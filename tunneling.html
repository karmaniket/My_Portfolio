                <p> One of the rules of Quantum Physics is that because particles also exhibit wave-like behavior
                    (Wave-particle duality), if there's a particle on one side of a barrier and it can't cross to the
                    other side, the wave function still exists and actually extends a little bit to the other side of
                    the barrier as well. Therefore, the electron can disappear from one side and reappear on the other side,
                    collapsing the wave-function and seemingly moving instantaneously.<br><br>
                <span> A phenomena known as "Quantum Mechanical Tunneling", This occurs frequently in our surroundings as well as 
                    in the cosmos. It's mysterious and amazing!
