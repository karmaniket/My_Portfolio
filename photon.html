                <p>"If Photons are massless then why do they get affected by Supermassive Black Holes? even though they
                    carry energy through their momentum."<span> Curious isn't it?</span><br><br>
                    As we know, Photons are electromagnetic energy considered as waves or particles, belonging to the
                    class of bosons. They cannot change direction until they encounter a reflective surface. They
                    always spin in a particular direction due to their angular momentum. Photons are massless, so they
                    always move at the speed of light, 3*10^8 m/s in a vacuum or viceversa.<br><br>
                <span>In space, massive bodies bend/warp space-time by forming a curve (by the General Theory of
                    Relativity). Photons always move in a particular direction but due to the curvature of space-time,
                    they are compelled to follow that path and may enter a black hole in the same way. However,
                    particles that move at the edges of the massive body may escape from the event horizon. That's why
                    we can only observe the edges (Photon sphere or Accretion disc) of the black hole except its center, 
                    which appears darker.</span><br><br>
                    Photons are generally unaffected by Supermassive Black Holes, yet they adhere to their
                    trajectory despite cosmic obstacles. It's a fascinating cosmic phenomenon.
                    However, the ultimate fate of particles that enter black hole's singularity where huge mass of
                    black hole is packed into an infinitely small space remains elusive, possibly leading to
                    speculation about white holes, but that's another theory for you soon!
