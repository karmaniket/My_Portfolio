                <p>A pulsar is a continuously rotating neutron star, also known as a white dwarf, that emits
                    accelerated particles, producing a powerful beam of photons along with electromagnetic pulses of
                    radiation at very regular intervals, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, and jets of
                    particles out along the two magnetic poles. They are responsible for the source of
                    ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. It can only be observed when that beam is pointing towards Earth,
                    similar to how laser light is visible only when directed towards an observer. It cannot be seen
                    amidst smoke like lasers because there is no smoke in space except for space clusters,
                    extraterrestrial dust particles, and interstellar clouds. Pulsars are utilized to detect extreme
                    states of matter, new planets beyond Earth's solar system, and energetic cosmic events such as
                    collisions of supermassive black holes.<br><br>
                <span>Vela pulsar is a neutron star that was formed when a massive star collapsed. It is about 1,000 light
                    years from Earth, spans about 12 miles in diameter, and makes over 11 complete rotations every
                    second, faster than a helicopter rotor. As the pulsar whips around, it spews out a jet of charged
                    particles that race out along the pulsar's rotation axis at about 70% of the speed of light.</span>
