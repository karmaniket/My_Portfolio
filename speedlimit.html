                <p>The famous speed limit imposed by <span>Einstein's Special Theory Of Relativity</span> also states that it
                    applies only to material objects moving within pre-existing space. However, space itself can expand
                    carrying objects with it and in that expansion it can reach arbitrarily high speeds. That's
                    precisely what happened in the early universe. In the first few moments of the universe it expanded
                    faster than the speed of light, with dark energy exerting pressure and forcing acceleration on our
                    expansion.<br><br>
                <span>Consequently, the edge of the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light. You
                    can neither see nor interact with it because the light it sends back to us will never reach us.
                    Amazing, isn't it?</span>
